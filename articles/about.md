### The web...not all of it sucks

The web still holds a lot of promise. Browsers and languages adopt new features constantly, and more and more things are becoming possible, without resorting to hacks and frameworks. 

I still believe in the power of the open web. I hope to see the day when hundreds of frameworks are replaced by one, agreed-upon solution. There's no reason why the prevailing options need to come from huge, self-interested corporations. Technologies that tip the scale in favor of the everyday person -- these are the things that keep me interested in tech.

### Focus on speed

I focus on speed and responsiveness. You can build the nicest, most accessible, easy-to-use UI, but if it takes 10 seconds to load, you might as well spend your resources on other things.

I have years of experience using different approaches to make the UI experience as snappy and smooth as possible.

### Holistic approach

Besides years of experience in technology, I have a multidisciplinary background, including photography, music, and the arts. Although I'm not a trained designer, I have an eye for what looks good, and I know what things are realistically possible on the web right now.

### Accessibility, device support

I work hard to make sure what I build is supported on as many modern devices and browsers as possible. I also have experience supporting older devices and browsers like IE 10, within reason. Content comes first. Well-strucutred, semantic markup has several positive side-effects, including better SEO placement, and easier maintenance/modifications.

### It's not just about code

I take code quality very seriously. But this is only a small part of building a good UI and a good system. I want to learn as much as possible about the people that will be using my code. This gives me a much better idea of what I will build and how I will build it.
