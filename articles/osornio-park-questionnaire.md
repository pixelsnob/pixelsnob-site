## What do you think of Osornio Park?

The City of La Habra has requested feedback from residents on how potential Prop 68 grant money could be used to improve our parks. The City has chosen four locations for potential consideration, and one of them is Osornio Park.

This **private, informal** survey, **not affiliated with the City of La Habra**, will attempt to measure residents' level of satisfaction with Osornio Park and how it is being utilized, along with any suggestions about how the park can be improved. The results of this survey, along with any suggestions, will be delivered to City leaders.

You may remain anonymous if you choose. You do not have to answer every question.
