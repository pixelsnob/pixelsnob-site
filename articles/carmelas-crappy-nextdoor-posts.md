title: Carmela's Crappy "Nextdoor" Internet Troll Posts
---

May 22, 2020

On May 19, 2020, my next-door neighbor decided to air a years-long feud between the both of us on the <a href="https://nextdoor.com/" target="_blank">Nextdoor</a> internet forum, where several internet trolls and death-wishers piled on with aggressive comments, until Nextdoor finally removed the entire thread. 

I am not sure if the thread will come back.

Whether the thread comes back or not, I do know one thing for sure: I denounce -- in the strongest terms -- how my next-door neighbor decided to deal with this. I also denounce -- in the strongest terms -- her negative characterizations of me, that she has spread around my immediate neighborhood, online and off.

Here are some of the screenshots, and some toxic examples of disgusting crap that people decided to spew at me that evening. It is amazing that these people -- some of whom are supposed "respected" professionals in their respective careers -- can act in such an immature, disgusting, and aggressive way when they think other people aren't looking.
