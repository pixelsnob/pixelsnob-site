## About My Work

Hello! My name is Luis Echeverria, and I'm a web developer with professional experience seeking steady employment, preferably on a remote team.

Some of the tech I have experience with:

* react, redux, redux-saga
* antd, react-virtualized, react-dnd (drag and drop)
* node.js/express/mongodb+mongoose, sails
* backbone.js, Web Components, "component based" architecture
* Semantically correct/accessible HTML5, CSS (and preprocessors such as less)
* Implmenenting dynamic UIs from mockups, PSD files
* SEO techniques
* ES6/7
* Webpack, Babel
* grunt/gulp, as well as basic shell scripting
* Puppeteer/Chrome DevTools Protocol/Casper/PhantomJS/JSDOM for automation, content "scraping", and rendering HTML
* Linux (Ubuntu)
* Jekyll (some)

Some of the things I'd be willing to learn/curious about:

* Dev-Ops/Testing/Automation
* Python
* Advanced functional programming techniques
* BEM (or other framework/methodology that encourages component-based architecture)
