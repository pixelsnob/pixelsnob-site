Hello! My name is Luis Echeverria, and I'm a web developer with professional experience seeking steady employment, preferably on a remote team.

Some of the tech I have experience with:

* JavaScript: ES6/7, webpack/babel, react, redux, redux-saga
* antd, react-virtualized, react-dnd (drag and drop)
* node.js/express/mongodb+mongoose, sails, postgres (some), mysql
* Semantically correct HTML5, CSS
* sass, less
* backbone.js, Web Components, component based architecture
* HTML layouts
* SEO techniques
* Puppeteer/Chrome DevTools Protocol/Casper/PhantomJS/JSDOM for automation, content "scraping", and rendering HTML
* grunt/gulp, as well as basic shell scripting
* Good eye for design

Some of the things I'd be willing to learn/curious about:

* Dev-Ops/Testing/Automation
* Python
* Advanced functional programming techniques
* BEM (or other framework/methodology that encourages component-based architecture)
